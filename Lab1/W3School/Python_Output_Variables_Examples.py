#Example 1
x = "Python is awesome"
print(x)

#Example 2
x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)

#Example 3
x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "awesome"
print(x + y + z)

#Example 4
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)

#Example 5 (Error when you try to combine a string and a number)
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x + y)

#Example 6 (Correct way)
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x, y)
